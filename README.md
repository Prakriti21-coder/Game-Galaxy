In “Game Galaxy,” players step into the spacesuit of a stranded astronaut. Lost amidst the cosmic expanse, they face a multi-level challenge:

Lost in Space: Drift through the void, seeking their vanished spaceship while managing oxygen and dodging debris.
The Celestial Maze: Explore an abandoned space station, deciphering clues to unlock hidden coordinates.
Alien Ambush: Battle hostile extraterrestrials in an asteroid field to reach their docked ship.
Alien Enigma: The spaceship’s activation requires solving an intricate alien image puzzle. With eerie visuals, cryptic symbols, and a cosmic soundtrack, the astronaut’s fate hangs in the balance.
